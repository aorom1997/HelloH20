Water Drinker App

A short report, describing the problem the project attempts to solve, its goals, alternative approaches to solving the problem, the chosen approach, 
and a justification for choosing it over other approaches (as appropriate for your case) 

  The purpose of this app was to solve the issue of people allowing themselves to become dehydrated by forgetting to carry or drink water on a daily basis. Dehydration
  can cause many undesireable affects on the body and the mind and can be solved by drinking water to maintain an healthy body and normal temperature. This app will also calculate
  how much water a user would need to drink on a hot day or after a light - heavy work out. An alternate approach would be have signs or more available areas for water for people.
  A corresponding app would be an app to show people a variety of areas that has accessible water for the user. I chose my apporach of a water reminder/tracker app because
  the availability of water can vary to being cost or paid and tracking water fountains that may not working.
  
Detailed, step-by-step, build/installation/initialization/launch instructions 
  The app should be quick and easily buildable within the android app studio. This application uses kotlin and was tested on a Pixel 2 with API 25 with Andorid 7.1.1
  
Detailed instructions how to use the software (if you are convinced it is self-explanatory and does not need instructions feel free to select "3")
  The app should be faily self explanitory. Each activity page will brief the user on what to input and what they are able to do. At the Water intake page, there are 4 icons
  The First icon (i) is an info page. The dumbell Icon is the workout page to input work out time and type. The Gear icon is the settings page where a bluetooth device can be
  connected as well as other settings. The weather icon includes the the weather for your area that was inputed in a previous activity screen.
